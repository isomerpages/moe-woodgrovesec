<p>Our memories bind us together as a Woodgrove Family and each year, we
curate them to remind ourselves about the times spent together, friendships
forged and achievements.</p>

<p>Capturing Memories Together</p>

<p>The school yearbook team of teachers made another move to use Googlesites
as a collaborative platform to chronicle our journey for the year. We believe
that memories are forged together and we hope to involve the wider Woodgrove
Community in 2023.</p>

<p>The school yearbook team of teachers worked together with CCA media representatives
and media club members. This marked our first attempt at developing a yearbook
together with our students - this gave them the opportunity to work on
an authentic project, cultivating values such as teamwork and being meticulous
with language used.</p>
