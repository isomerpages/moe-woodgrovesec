<p>Our memories bind us together as a Woodgrove Family and each year, we
curate them to remind ourselves about the times spent together, friendships
forged and achievements.</p>

<p>Capturing Memories Together</p>

</p>
<p>The school yearbook team of teachers made another move to use Googlesites
as a collaborative platform to chronicle our journey for the year. We believe
that memories are forged together and we hope to involve the wider Woodgrove
Community in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>2023</strong>

<p></p>
<p>The school yearbook team of teachers worked together with CCA media representatives
and media club members. This marked our first attempt at developing a yearbook
together with our students - this gave them the opportunity to work on
an authentic project, cultivating values such as teamwork and being meticulous
with language used.</p>

<p><strong>2024</strong>
</p>
<p>The school continued the practice of making the yearbook a collaborative
effort between teachers and students, fostering a spirit of teamwork and
creativity within the school community. This approach not only gives students
the opportunity to take ownership of the publication process but also allows
them to work closely with their teachers, learning valuable skills such
as design, content creation, and project management. This year's edition
holds special significance as it commemorates the school's 25th Anniversary,
making it a milestone publication. The yearbook serves as a reflection
of the school's rich history and achievements, capturing the vibrant memories,
stories, and milestones that have shaped the school over the years.</p>

<p><strong>2025</strong>
</p>
<p>There was a greater focus on using the Yearbook Project as a platform
to develop essential life skills among students. One key aspect of this
initiative was empowering members of the Media Club to lead training sessions
for media representatives from other CCAs, guiding them in creating their
yearbook pages. Communication skills were emphasized throughout the process,
with Media Club members having the opportunity to interview the Principal,
further honing their interview and interpersonal abilities.</p>
