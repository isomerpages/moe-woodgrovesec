<p><strong>The School Crest</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The school's crest features a stylised bird perched on the branch of a
tree.</p>
<p>The school crest depicts birds ready to soar into the sky from a sturdy
branch. The birds signify Woodgrovers as dynamic learners, grounded on
sound values and daring to fly up high to achieve their goals and overcome
future challenges. The leaves signify life and growth in a harmonious,
safe and supportive environment as the school prepares the learners well
in the pursuit of their dreams.</p>
<p>The colour yellow symbolises positive attitudes and a strong commitment
to excel in one’s responsibilities. The colour orange mirrors a burning
passion, the vigour and hunger for progress as well as a determination
to achieve one’s goals. The colour green denotes virtue and an appreciation
for aesthetics, while white projects purity, integrity as well as a professional
image and standard.</p>
