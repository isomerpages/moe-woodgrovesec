The school's crest features a stylised bird perched on the branch of a tree.

The school crest depicts birds ready to soar into the sky from a sturdy branch. The birds signify Woodgrovers as dynamic learners, grounded on sound values and daring to fly up high to achieve their goals and overcome future challenges. The leaves signify life and growth in a harmonious, safe and supportive environment as the school prepares the learners well in the pursuit of their dreams.

The colour yellow symbolises positive attitudes and a strong commitment to excel in one’s responsibilities. The colour orange mirrors a burning passion, the vigour and hunger for progress as well as a determination to achieve one’s goals. The colour green denotes virtue and an appreciation for aesthetics, while white projects purity, integrity as well as a professional image and standard.
