Our memories bind us together as a Woodgrove Family and each year, we curate them to remind ourselves about the times spent together, friendships forged and achievements.

Digital Milestone

For the first time, our yearbook was published in digital form as part of our green efforts. We also believe that a easily accessible yearbook is both convenient and enables us to reach out to a wider audience with our Woodgrove Story.

Capturing Memories Together

The school yearbook team of teachers made another move to use Googlesites as a collaborative platform to chronicle our journey for the year. We believe that memories are forged together and we hope to involve the wider Woodgrove Community in 2023.
