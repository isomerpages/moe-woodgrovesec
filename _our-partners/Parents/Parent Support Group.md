All parents of students enrolled into Woodgrove Secondary School can participate in the activities organised by the parent support group.

The Parent Support Group is led by a team of parents in the core team.
  

#### What Does the Parent Support Group Do?

**1. We Learn and Grow Together.**

We gather  to network and know each other better, share our concerns and learn more about the school. We also attend seminars to understand more about school and MOE initiatives in order to connect with our children better. There are also opportunities for us to bond with our children.

**2. Members play a role in empowering students.**

Our parents also play an important role in helping our students expand their world view beyond school. This includes sharing with them about their careers and industries they work in.
