The parent-child toolkit aims to encourage better communication between parent and child. Hence, we have placed all important information for both parent and child on the same platform.

Both parent and child will be able to access regular details such as:

- Class Timetables
- CCA Schedules
- Weighted Assessment Details
- ACE Program Details (Remedial Program)
- Financial Subsidies Available
- Insurance Claims
