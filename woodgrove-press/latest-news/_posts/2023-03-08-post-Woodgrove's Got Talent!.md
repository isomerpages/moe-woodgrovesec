With the aim of creating a platform for students to showcase their talents in front of the school, Woodgrove's Got Talent kicked off with a few high-quality and high-octane performances during morning assembly. 

Woodgrovers were serenaded by a musical ensemble and wowed by a nimble-footed jump-rope routine, then rounded the morning off with a dynamic dance duo. Looking forward to seeing what other talents Woodgrovers have in store!
