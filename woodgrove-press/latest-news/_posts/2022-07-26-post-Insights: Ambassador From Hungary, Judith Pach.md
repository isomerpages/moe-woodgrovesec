In July 2022, we held our very first EU@school programme at WGS!The ambassador to Singapore from Hungary, Ms Judith Pach, gave us insights into Hungarian culture as well as the European Union. Following a short talk in the school hall, Ms Pach engaged in a dialogue with some of our Sec 3 students, delighting them with wonderful tidbits about Hungary as well as innovations that Singapore and Hungary are embarking on, especially in green recovery efforts. Thank you, Ms Pach, for spending the afternoon with us!
