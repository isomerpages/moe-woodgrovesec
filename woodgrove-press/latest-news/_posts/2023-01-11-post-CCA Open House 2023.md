Our Secondary One students went through the myriad experiences of the CCA Open House in early January to help them decide which CCA would be the best fit for each of them.
  
There was plenty of excitement among the Secondary 1 students, with the CCA leaders actively engaging and encouraging their juniors to participate in their planned activities. A wide range of options were available, from Uniformed Groups to Clubs and Societies, and Sports to Performing Arts, all catering to the different interests and talents of our students.
  
We hope the newest members of our school had a fun and fulfilling time at the Open House!
