Today marks the Graduation Day for our Secondary 4 & 5 Woodgrovers. They started off with taking class photos and photobooth shots, before they made their way for their Graduation Ceremony.  
  
During the ceremony, on top of going down memory lane of their journey in WGS, our seniors were showered with well wishes, encouragement and word of advice from their juniors, peers and teachers.  
  
Thereafter, before heading to canteen for lunch, we had our first ever cohort photo taken at the parade square. It might be the last official school day for our seniors, but always remember that the you are always welcome back to WGS as you journey in your last lap of your national examinations.  
  
All the best, Woodgrovers!
