Dear Reader,

Woodgrove Secondary School has been in existence for more than 20 years and we are honoured to be helming a school that has developed strengths in various fields such as environmental education, and emerging niche areas such as Youth Community Leadership and STEM for Sustainable Living in the Community.

Through the years, the school has had her ups and downs but time and again, the Woodgrove family has always rallied and soared above difficult times. The post-covid world presents a new set of challenges and opportunities for our students and we certainly look forward to preparing our students into becoming future ready learners and thoughtful leaders.

Our team of teachers are committed to developing our students through various specially curated learning experiences and we believe that our students can excel in both academic and non-academic areas. 

Finally, it does take a village to raise a child. We value the efforts of our parents, alumni and partners in helping to raise mature and responsible adults of the future.

Best Regards,

Mr Chua (Principal)
Mr Tan Boon Cheng, Mdm Chitra (Vice-Principals: Curriculum)
Mdm Priscilla Tan (Vice-Principal: Curriculum)
