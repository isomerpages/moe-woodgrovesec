#### Chinese Orchestra

Established in 2002, the Chinese Orchestra is a vibrant and inclusive CCA dedicated to nurturing a lifelong passion for Chinese musical traditions. Under the dedicated guidance of professional musicians, our students receive exceptional training to master their instruments, develop musical excellence, and build a strong foundation in teamwork and discipline. We are proud to provide a dynamic platform for our young musicians to shine, from exhilarating school performances to prestigious national competitions and meaningful community outreach events. More than just a CCA, we are a close-knit family where students forge deep and lasting friendships, support one another's growth, and build immense confidence together. True to our motto, "Attaining Musicality, Bridging Destinies," we strive to create harmonious melodies that resonate not only on stage but also in the hearts of our members and the community we serve.
