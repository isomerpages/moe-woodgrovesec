**Chinese Orchestra**

Founded in the year 2002, the Chinese Orchestra seeks to develop a strong sense of musicality and appreciation for the tenets of Chinese musical culture amongst our students. As a CCA of choice, we strongly believe in the values of perseverance, teamwork, innovation, commitment, excellence and practice in order to excel and overcome. The Chinese saying goes 熟能生巧，勤能补拙，or Practice makes perfect; we aspire to be a world-class Chinese Orchestra with students who are confident and concerned citizens of the future.
