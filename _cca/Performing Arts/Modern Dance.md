**DANCE** as a form of the arts has a character and identity of its own and cannot simply be regarded as another sport or a form of gymnastics. Its long history as an independent art in human society, and the unique roles it plays in cultures throughout the world, mean that it must be understood in its own right.

  

On many levels, dance is a genuine form of exercise and a learning experience. Apart from promoting the joy of self-expression, the act of dancing is a great form of cardio-vascular exercise known to increase self-confidence and self-esteem.

  

Dance also improves posture, tones and strengthens the body. Skills required for effectiveness in everyday living, including self-motivation, leadership, teamwork, communication and time management are other positive outcomes of dance education.

  

Dance as an art has a significant role to play in the holistic education in our schools. Even if a child can never carry his efforts far enough to realise dance in its highest forms, he should still be granted the chance to experience the joy of the rhythmic sense of free, controlled and expressive movement, and through this, be led to discover an important part of life.

#### More about us

Our main objective is to build character, teamwork and responsibility in our students. You may or may not be a dancer in primary school but if you want to learn and try it out, we definitely welcome you. "Unlocking the dancer in us" is the theme for 2017, and that's what we aim to do. Also its primary aim is to foster an appreciation and passion for dance as an art form, which in turns develop pupils both physically and aesthetically. We also provide opportunities for students to develop their leadership qualities and interpersonal skills.
