#### Modern Dance

The Modern Dance team aims to transform students into passionate dancers and inculcate a deep appreciation for dance. It encourages students to try dance regardless of whether they have the necessary experience in primary school. It believes that every student can foster an appreciation and passion for dance as an art form. This develops students both physically and aesthetically. Through dance, students can develop leadership qualities and interpersonal skills.

The Modern Dance also has a proud record of achieving numerous accolades at the national level in events such as the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and the SEA games opening ceremony. It has also played a role in performing for school events such as Speech Day.
