#### Introduction

Since the school started in 2000, the Woodgrove Symphonic Band has grown from a 40-member unit to one that is 80-members strong.

  

The Band's motto of One Band, One Heart, One Sound, captures the goals of

(i) developing a lifelong life-long passion for and appreciation of music and

(ii) working together as one to provide music to encourage or inspire others.

  

The Band has put up many public performances, including an outreach at the Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange in 2018 as well as as a guest band in Beautiful Tunes II at the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre in 2019 and Musical Rhapsodies in the Garden at the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage in 2020.

  

To deepen and widen their musical and cultural experiences, the Band also went on an overseas Music Exchange program, collaborating with two local schools, as well as also performing at Hong Kong Disneyland in Hong Kong in 2015.
