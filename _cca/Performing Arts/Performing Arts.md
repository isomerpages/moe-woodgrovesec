#### History and Achievements

Woodgrove Secondary School’s Chinese Orchestra (WGSCO) was established in 2002. Since inception, the CO has participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging five times and the SYF Arts Presentation twice. We have achieved **2 Silver Awards** in 2003 and 2005, **3 Gold Awards** in 2007, 2009 and 2011, **1 Certificate of Accomplishment in 2017**, as well as **3 Certificates of Distinction in 2013** and 2015 and 2019.

  

WGSCO is also actively engaged in public performances at the **community and national level** (e.g. Singapore Management University, Victoria Concert Hall, Far East Plaza Shopping Centre, National Library, ACE the Place Community Club, Causeway Point). We are also honoured to have played for major school events such as the School's Speech Day, Aesthetic Night as well as the Mid-Autumn Festival Celebrations.

  

Our members have also had the opportunity to perform alongside world-class musicians and performers, while simultaneously breaking Guinness World Records. In 2014, our Orchestra was invited by the Singapore Chinese Orchestra to be a part of the 4000-strong One People One Music (OPOM) Mega Concert held at the new Sports Hub, breaking 2 Guinness World Records in the Process. In the same year, we also organized a Music Exchange and Immersion Programme to Taiwan with 碧华国中, a local High School, where our students had the chance to perform their SYF set pieces, Winds Crescent (见快的凉风) and North-Eastern Wind ( 东北风) with their Taiwanese counterparts, obtaining and exchanging invaluable performance tips and pointers.
