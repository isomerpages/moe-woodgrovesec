Woodgrove Secondary School (WGS) football started off as an interest group where students form teams within school to compete against one another for the Woodgrove Secondary Soccer League championship. The Woodgrove Secondary Soccer League served as a platform to allow students to come together and enjoy playing football on and off the field.

  

WGS football Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) is established in 2007 as a recreational football team which seeks to develop students, with or without prior experience of football, with relevant football knowledge and skills to encourage learning and promote healthy living. The football team took part in ad-hoc football games organised by the grassroots communities to further put their knowledge and skills in practice.

  

In 2008, the football CCA became an official CCA with an aim to further develop the students holistically in their knowledge, skills and values. The students will be educated to be resilient and disciplined through the training programmes. Furthermore, the football CCA seeks effective methods to develop their fitness and strength to stay competitive for the National School Games. The CCA selection emphasises strongly on students’ attitude towards CCA and other school commitments.
