#### Badminton

Woodgrove Secondary School (WGS) Badminton started off as a recreational CCA for both boys and girls with or without prior experience in badminton. The focus was to develop some knowledge and skills in badminton, build interest in the sports and to promote a healthy lifestyle.

In 2015, the school engaged its first badminton coach and WGS Badminton CCA became an all-boys competitive team with the aim to further develop the players’ knowledge, skills and values in badminton. Every year, the team represents the school in the North Zone ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division Boys Badminton Championship. Besides developing in terms of knowledge and skills during training and matches, the players also contribute to the society through Service Learning projects. In 2023, the school’s badminton team marked a milestone with the formation of the girl's team.
