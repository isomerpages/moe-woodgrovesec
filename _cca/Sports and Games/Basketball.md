#### Basketball

The school’s basketball team was formed in 2000. Since 2001, the team has participated in competitions at the Zonal and National level. It has achieved numerous accolades since then. 

Apart from developing the skills of play and teamwork, the CCA also develops members holistically by requiring players to embark on Service Learning projects to assist the less fortunate in the community. 

In the Basketball team, it is believed that every member can develop self-confidence and self-esteem, possess the resilience needed during competitions, work together and rise up to lead, and thrive in a positive environment that fosters discipline, dedication, teamwork and sportsmanship.
