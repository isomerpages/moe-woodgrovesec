<h4>Basketball</h4>
<p>The schoolâ€™s basketball team was formed in 2000. Since 2001, the team
has participated in competitions at the Zonal and National level. It has
achieved numerous accolades since then.</p>
<p>Apart from developing the skills of play and teamwork, the CCA also develops
members holistically by requiring players to embark on Service Learning
projects to assist the less fortunate in the community.</p>
<p>In the Basketball team, it is believed that every member can develop self-confidence
and self-esteem, possess the resilience needed during competitions, work
together and rise up to lead, and thrive in a positive environment that
fosters discipline, dedication, teamwork and sportsmanship.</p>
