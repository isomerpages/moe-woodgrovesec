#### Media Club

The Media Club aims to be the school’s reliable partner for producing in-house publications such as the school’s online yearbook and social media posts. It also strives to provide technical expertise that are instrumental for school events such as flag raising ceremonies in the morning, assembly programmes and Speech Day. Students of the Media Club also master the art of photography and dabble with creating videos. 

Through the various activities, students cultivate teamwork and creativity. Through their learning experience with social media, students appreciate how to harness the power of the internet to influence and impact. Students of the Media Club have also participated in projects at the National Level such as the Our Schools Our Stories photography exhibition.
