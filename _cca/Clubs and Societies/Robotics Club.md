#### Robotics Club

Started in 2016, the Robotics Club aims to promote the use of ICT in students’ learning, ignite creativity, and cultivate awareness in Cyber Wellness. At the Robotics Club, students play and make with technology, sparking imagination and building confidence. Students learn computational thinking and making, and are exposed to coding concepts through a blend of software inputs (visual/syntax-based programming language) and hardware outputs (Robotics and Microcontrollers). Guided by teachers and trainers, students will acquire abilities like logical thinking, reasoning, sequencing, estimation and inventive thinking.

**Training Days**

	Tuesdays: 3:30 - 5:30pm 
	Thursdays: 3:30 - 5:30pm (Seasonal)

\*Additional sessions will be organised for selected students for the preparation of various events. Sessions are subject to change.
