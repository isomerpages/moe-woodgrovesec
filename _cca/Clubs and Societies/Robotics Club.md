Robotics Club started in 2016.

  

In RC, our aim is to:

1.  Promote the use of ICT in students’ learning
2.  Promote creativity
3.  Promote awareness in Cyberwellness

  

Students play and make with technology, sparking imagination and building creative confidence.

  

In Robotics, students learn computational thinking and making, and are exposed to coding concepts through a blend of software inputs (visual/syntax-based programming language) and hardware outputs (Robotics and Microcontrollers). Guided by teachers and trainers, students will acquire abilities like logical thinking, reasoning, sequencing, estimation and inventive thinking.

Students are also trained in photography and photo-editing skills. To develop their photography skills, members attend photography courses and go on learning journeys with the CCA to practice their photography and handling of DSLR cameras.
