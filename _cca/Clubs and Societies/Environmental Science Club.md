#### CCA Past and Present

The Green Activists Club started in 2002. From a mere 15 students in 2002, the club has not only grown in size but also in stature.    

  

In 2021, Green Activists Club was renamed into Environmental Science Club (ESC), to incorporate Science and Technology to solve environmental issues.

  

The **key programmes and projects** of the Environmental Science Club focus on various environmental themes such as climate action, water and energy conservation, nature and biodiversity appreciation, as well as green buildings and features. We also organise different types of green competitions, camps and workshops for pre-schools, primary school children and secondary school students. These are some of the ways through which we **create greater awareness on environmental issues and events** in the students and community.

  

The Environmental Science Club actively **collaborates with other schools** in EE Trial, camps and workshops to exchange ideas and enable our students to lead and facilitate in the activities. Besides organising these camps and workshops, the ESC members **learn valuable skills and values** through participating in learning journeys and signing up for competitions related to the environmental theme. It provides a platform for participants to **showcase their talents and apply their knowledge in environment education** to achieve the objective of the competitions. There are also other platforms for ESC members to learn to be good student-leaders as well as responsible team-players. The ESC also creates awareness among staff and students in the school through Inter-Class Recycling Challenge and making Teachers’ Day Gifts to show appreciation and application of upcycling.

  

In addition, we have very supportive and strong **green partners** who have provided the ESC members and other Woodgrovers various learning opportunities. Our green partners include:

  

*   Ministry of the Environment & Water Resources (MEWR)
*   National Environment Agency (NEA)
*   PUB (The National Water Agency)
*   National Parks Board (NParks)
*   Singapore Environment Council (SEC)
*   Waterways Watch Society (WWS)
*   SembWaste
*   Building and Construction Authority (BCA)
*   Public Hygiene Council and North West CDC

#### Mission

To educate Environmental Science Club members in WGS Environment Education (EE) and ignite their passion to do their part for the environment. Students will take up ownership and responsibility to plan and carry events to create greater environment awareness for their friends in school, their family members as well as to the public.

#### Vision

To elevate Environmental Science Club members' effort in lifelong learning in environment education and apply Science and Technology knowledge to tackle environmental issues.
