#### Environmental Science Club

Established in 2002 with 15 students, the Environmental Science Club has played a key role in shaping environmental education in the school. The key programmes and projects of the club focus on various environmental themes such as climate action, water and energy conservation, nature and biodiversity appreciation, as well as green buildings and features. These are some of the ways through which the club creates greater awareness on environmental issues and events in the students and community.

In addition, the club has supportive and strong green partners who have provided its members and other Woodgrovers various learning opportunities. 

**Training Days**

Monday : 3.30pm to 5.30pm

\*Additional sessions will be organised for selected students for the preparation of various events. Sessions are subject to change.
