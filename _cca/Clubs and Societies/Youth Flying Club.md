**Youth Flying Club**

The Youth Flying Club (YFC) hopes to promote aviation among youths and inculcate a strong passion for flying. To achieve this, students embark on aeromodelling and flight simulation courses.

Members of the YFC experience hands-on activities such as first-person view (FPV) drone flying, designing and building unpowered gliders and flight simulation with the guidance of experienced instructors. Members of the YFC participate in inter-school competitions such as the Singapore Amazing Flying machine Competition (SAFMC) organised by Science Centre and Defence Science Organisation (DSO). YFC committee members are given the opportunity to lead and serve, they are also given the opportunity to take ownership to plan and execute bonding sessions among the YFC members
