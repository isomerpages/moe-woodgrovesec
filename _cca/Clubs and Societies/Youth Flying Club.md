Youth Flying Club of Woodgrove Secondary School hopes to promote aviation among youths in our school and inculcate them to have a strong passion for flying. To achieve this, the school’s YFC is working hand in hand with Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) as well as Just Fly It Pte Ltd. SYFC and Just Fly It Pte Ltd provide aeromodelling and flight simulation courses for our members weekly on CCA days.

  

Members of the school’s YFC have a hands-on session on activities such as first-person view (FPV) drone flying, design and build unpowered gliders and flight simulation with the guidance of experienced instructors. Besides the above activities mentioned, annually members of YFC will participate in inter-school competitions organized by SYFC and Singapore Amazing Flying machine Competition (SAFMC) organised by Science Centre and Defence Science Organisation (DSO). YFC committee members are given the opportunity to lead and serve, they are also given the opportunity to take the ownership to plan and execute bonding sessions among the YFC members as well as a day camp. The camp has helped to nurture and develop the students in life skills such as leadership, discipline, responsibility and teamwork. At the same time members showed care and concern among their CCA mates.
