#### National Civil Defense Cadet Corps

Established in 2024, NCDCC believes in developing and empowering our youths to be active & concerned citizens with life-saving skills. NCDCC focuses on developing greater awareness of civil defence in our cadets and prepare them with the skills to respond effectively to emergencies at home and abroad. The attitude of readiness against adversity and practical skills which are critical in the face of danger and emergencies are life-long capabilities that our young civil defence ambassadors can have.
