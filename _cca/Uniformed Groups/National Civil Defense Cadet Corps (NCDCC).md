<h4>National Civil Defence Cadet Corps</h4>
<p>Established in 2024, NCDCC believes in developing and empowering our youths
to be active &amp; concerned citizens with life-saving skills. NCDCC focuses
on developing greater awareness of civil defence in our cadets and prepare
them with the skills to respond effectively to emergencies at home and
abroad. The attitude of readiness against adversity and practical skills
which are critical in the face of danger and emergencies are life-long
capabilities that our young civil defence ambassadors can have.</p>
