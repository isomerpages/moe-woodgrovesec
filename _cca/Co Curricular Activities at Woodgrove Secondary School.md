At Woodgrove Secondary School, we believe that Co Curricular Activities (CCA) play an integral part for a child's character development. 

Beyond the various activities that our students participate in, we highlight the importance of reflecting on the values and skills acquired through various activities. This empowers our students to understand the significance of transferring these values and skills to other aspects of their lives.

CCAs play an integral role in helping our students attain various levels in the LEAPS 2.0 points system. To find out more about LEAPS 2.0, please click [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/our-programmes/cca/leaps2-0).
