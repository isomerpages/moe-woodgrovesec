At Woodgrove Secondary School, we believe that Co Curricular Activities (CCA) play an integral part of a child's character development. 

Beyond the various activities that our students participate in, we highlight the importance of reflecting on the values and skills acquired through various activities. This empowers our students to understand the significance of transferring these values and skills to other real life situations. 

We have a wide range of CCAs that cater to a variety of interests.
