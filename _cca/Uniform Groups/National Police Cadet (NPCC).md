#### Mission

The MISSION of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active and community leaders, by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.

  

#### Vision

The VISION of the National Police Cadet Corps is to become the best youth organisation in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world.

  

#### Core Values

In line with our mission and vision, we believe that our association with the National Police Cadet Corps will:

  

1.  **ENSURE** our growth by challenging ourselves to set high standards in the unit which in turn, will stretch our leadership qualities, build our character and inculcate strong social and moral values.
2.  **ENLIGHTEN** us on the role of the Singapore Police Force to understand the need to keep Singapore safe and strengthen our relationship and bond with the force.
3.  As part of a culture that encourage and motivate us to treat fellow cadets with respect, courtesy and tact, **TEACH** us to extend the same care and concern to others.
