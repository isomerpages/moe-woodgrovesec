#### National Police Cadet Corps

The National Police Cadet Corps strives to develop its members to be active community leaders, by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.

In order to do so, the unit encourages students to challenge themselves to set high standards and cultivateÂ  leadership qualities, as well as, build character and inculcate strong social and moral values. The unit has a culture that encourages and motivates cadets to treat each other with respect, courtesy and tact.
