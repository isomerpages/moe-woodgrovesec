At Woodgrove Secondory School, we believe in forging a strong partnership between parent, child and school. One such platform that encourages this is the Parent-Child Toolkit. 

Please refer to the [Parent-Child Toolkit](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/parentssupportwithwoodgrovesec/home) for the email addresses of our Form Teachers and School Counsellors if you need to contact them.
