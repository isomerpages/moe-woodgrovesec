At Woodgrove Secondary School, we believe in forging a strong partnership between parent, child and school. One such platform that encourages this is the Parent-Child Toolkit. 

Please refer to the [Parent-Child Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJF28M6tq9brzRobOmlRMLNUf62ZB2tbPi8BwWL54x4/edit) for the email addresses of our Form Teachers and School Counsellors if you need to contact them.
