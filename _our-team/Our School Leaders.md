<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>On behalf of everyone at Woodgrove Secondary School (WGS), let me extend
a very warm welcome to our school and wonderful community.&nbsp; We hope
our website will provide a good glimpse into the holistic and engaging
experience we provide for all our Woodgrovers</p>
<p>As our Woodgrovers experience the richness of the national curriculum
and school programmes, our vision is for them to be “future-ready learners
and thoughtful leaders”.&nbsp; We are committed to our mission of nurturing
Woodgrovers of character with a passion for lifelong learning and active
citizenship. &nbsp;We take pride in empowering Woodgrovers in the area
of Student Leadership and Student Voice, where they are given various opportunities
to improve the school learning environment and serve the wider community.
Through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP)&nbsp; Science for Sustainable
Living, students are given the&nbsp;platform to experiment and apply STEM
concepts to solve problems in everyday living and address environmental
concerns.</p>
<p>Our school core values – “Be Your Best Self, Embrace Challenges, Practise
Gratitude, Serve to Lead” are well-embodied by all staff and students in
their daily activities and interactions.&nbsp; We are also very grateful
to the strong support from our School Advisory Committee members, Alumni
and Parents.&nbsp; With a clear focus on our school’s Vision, Mission and
Values, it is our collective commitment in providing a safe and nurturing
environment for all Woodgrovers to learn and grow together</p>
<p>We are very proud of WGS and especially proud of our amazing Woodgrovers.
Please feel free to visit us and see our wonderful school for yourself.
We would be delighted to meet you and welcome you into WGS!</p>
