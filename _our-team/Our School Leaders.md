Dear Readers,

On behalf of everyone at Woodgrove Secondary School (WGS), let me extend a very warm welcome to our school and wonderful community.  We hope our website will provide a good glimpse into the holistic and engaging experience we provide for all our Woodgrovers

As our Woodgrovers experience the richness of the national curriculum and school programmes, our vision is for them to be “future-ready learners and thoughtful leaders”.  We are committed to our mission of nurturing Woodgrovers of character with a passion for lifelong learning and active citizenship.  We take pride in empowering Woodgrovers in the area of Student Leadership and Student Voice, where they are given various opportunities to improve the school learning environment and serve the wider community. Through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP)  Science for Sustainable Living, students are given the platform to experiment and apply STEM concepts to solve problems in everyday living and address environmental concerns.

Our school core values – “Be Your Best Self, Embrace Challenges, Practise Gratitude, Serve to Lead” are well-embodied by all staff and students in their daily activities and interactions.  We are also very grateful to the strong support from our School Advisory Committee members, Alumni and Parents.  With a clear focus on our school’s Vision, Mission and Values, it is our collective commitment in providing a safe and nurturing environment for all Woodgrovers to learn and grow together

We are very proud of WGS and especially proud of our amazing Woodgrovers. Please feel free to visit us and see our wonderful school for yourself. We would be delighted to meet you and welcome you into WGS!

Chua Chor Huat
