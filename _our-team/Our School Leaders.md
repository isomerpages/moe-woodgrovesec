Dear Reader,

In WGS, we strive to equip our Woodgrovers with the necessary skills and mind-sets to be effective life-long learners. Thus, we believe in creating many learning opportunities and platforms for students to explore, through which they can discover their passions and talents. Beyond the regular secondary school curriculum, we provide real-life applications of learning in all our subjects, particularly through our schoolâ€™s Applied Learning Programme on Sustainability and Learning for Life Programme on Community and Youth Leadership.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges to the educational landscape, there are also exciting opportunities ahead in the dawn of this new digital era which has spurred and championed the use of various digital platforms. As we adapt to new norms and prepare for the implementation of key MOE initiatives such as the use of personal learning devices and Full Subject-Based Banding, our whole school community will forge ahead in this new chapter of life with confidence and steadfastness.

We are excited for the opportunities to learn and grow in the forthcoming years, and our greatest strength lies in our commitment to provide an all-rounded education for our students.

Best Regards,

Mr Chua (Principal)
Mr Tan Boon Cheng, Mdm Chitra (Vice-Principals: Curriculum)
Mdm Priscilla Tan (Vice-Principal: Curriculum)
