The school's logo features a stylised bird perched on the branch of a tree.

**The bird** represents our Woodgrovers soaring to become the best versions of themselves. Orange and yellow are colours that  reflect our passionate Woodgrovers possesing the fire to work towards being future ready learners and thoughtful leaders. This would mean striving to become their best selves, serving to lead, and embracing challenges. 

The **tree branch** represents the Woodgrover having a sense of rootedness even as they soar. This encapculates the importance of having a sense of gratitude through one's life journey.

The use of symbols related to nature reminds Woodgrovers that they are part of a wider ecosystem. There is a community present that can support them in achieving their dreams.
