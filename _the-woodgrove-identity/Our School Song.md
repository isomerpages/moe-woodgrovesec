Our school song was jointly composed by the school's first principal, Mrs Helena Song, and her team of pioneer teachers. First sung in 2000, the lyrics remain unchanged. 

The first rendition of the school song was sung by the school's chorale in 2000. 

In 2021, a more contemporary version was produced by the school choir under the guidance of our music teacher, Ms Jwen Lim, choir teachers, Mdm Prisiclla Lui, Ms Adilla, Ms Goh Lilin and choir coach Mr Tan Kok Leong.
