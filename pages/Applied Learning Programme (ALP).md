#### STEM for Sustainable Living in the Community

STEM for Sustainable Living in the Community&nbsp;has been chosen as the school’s Applied Learning Programme as we aim to leverage on our school’s strengths on environmental education and design education. This programme will introduce students to the concepts of sustainable development in three key areas: water, energy and food.  

  

Students will carry out laboratory work and project tasks during lessons. Through these inter-disciplinary activities, students experience both the Scientific Inquiry Process and Design Thinking Process. They also acquire knowledge in subjects such as Science, Geography and Design &amp; Technology.

Applied learning experiences for students also take place during co-curriculum activities. Through programmes such as learning journeys, competitions and enrichment workshops, students further deepen their understanding of the concepts in sustainable development.
