#### Mission

Global Citizens, Passion to Serve

  

The Humanities Department aims to develop learners who are global citizens with the passion to take an active role in the bettering of the lives of the people, society and environment.  

  

The department consciously delivers the curriculum using the inquiry approach. Beyond the knowledge and skills, we hope that learners will develop an interest in the study of Humanities through the offering of a wide range of programmes. We believe in making the learning of Humanities come alive through authentic learning experiences.

  

The following are some of our signature department programmes:

#### 1.    WGS Model United Nations Conference

Aim:  

*   To raise students’ awareness on current issues and the impacts of international affairs and decisions
*   To developing public speaking and critical reasoning skills within students
*   To ensure that students are cognizant of the multiple perspectives of various stakeholders in the international arena

  

Description:

The WGS MUN is an academic simulation of the United Nations’ conferences and dialogue session wherein delegates from various countries coalesce to discuss international or transnational affairs that affect every stakeholder in the international arena, be it big or small. WGS MUN saw students playing the roles of delegates from different countries and engaging in academic debates.

#### 2.    Geographical and Historical Investigations

Aim:  

*   To develop students’ interest in Geography and History
*   To develop students’ skills in acquiring and communicating geographical and historical knowledge through the study of primary sources
*   To develop an appreciation for the environment and the past so as to contribute actively and responsibly as local and global citizens

  

Description:

Students go through the various processes involved in the investigations such as data collection, analysing the data, making conclusions and reflection. They are also exposed to different skills such as making inferences, use of weather instruments and interview skills. Not only do the investigations allow students to learn and apply their knowledge and skills in the real-world context, more importantly, it makes learning comes alive and enjoyable for them.

  

The photos show the students collecting data at the various field sites.
