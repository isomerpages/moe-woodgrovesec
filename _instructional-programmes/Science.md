#### Mission
Making Science Learning fun, meaningful and relevant for all

  

The Science Department aims to nurture students to become scientific literate citizens. Equipped with a strong grounding in the scientific knowledge and the practices of science, our students will be able to make informed decisions about science related issues, innovate and push the frontiers of science. The enculturation of positive values and attitudes allows them to function well as global citizens with the passion to use science in improving lives of self, society and the environment.

  

This is achieved through the use of the 3E’s

\-   **Engage** in real-world phenomena, <br>
\-   **Explore** the scienctific concepts through experimentation and model making, <br>
\-   **Empower** students to make a positive impact to self, and society through our Science lessons and activities.

#### Biology lesson at Blood Bank

Biology students have part of their biology lessons covered with a visit to the blood bank. With the knowledge they acquired, the students setup a booth during their recess and lunch breaks to encourage their teachers and peers to understand more about blood donation and to adopt a healthier lifestyle.

  

We believe meaningful and relevant science learning goes beyond classroom lessons and laboratory practical. Hence, we curate and provide students with enrichment activities across levels and stream to further engage them in scientific issues in daily life, society and the environment.

  

Students also participate in Science Competitions for richer experience in scientific practices.

#### Scientific Inquiry Research Experience (SIRE) 2019

Our Secondary One research team explored the possibility of converting the Durian Seeds Into Bioplastics. The team believed that bioplastics can reduce the plastic waste in the global community.

#### IN3 (Inspire, Innovate, Inquire) Science Talk 2019

The inaugural IN3 Science Talk was graced by Dr Mark Lim, a Lead Scientist in the Energy Research Institute at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

  

Objectives:

*   To inspire students’ interest in the learning of Science
*   To provide opportunities for authentic learning beyond classroom and curriculum especially in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM)
*   To hear from industry experts about current trends and potential career opportunities in STEM

#### Learning Journey to NUS Science Demonstration Lab

Physics students have the opportunity to see the applications of physics through the use many everyday materials in the demonstrations.

  

**_“I used to think that physics are only in the nature of engineering Now I think that physics can be in the matter of every substance and connected through various ways.”_**

  

Objectives: <br>
To allow students to deepen the understanding of the concepts learnt through visually and intellectually Science

#### Secondary 2 Science Trails @ Singapore Science Centre

Our Secondary Two students have the opportunity to see the scientific concepts they learnt in class come to live at the various trails at Science Centre.

  

Objectives: <br>
To allow students to experience the scientific concepts and phenomena that they have learnt or will be learning in their science lessons.
