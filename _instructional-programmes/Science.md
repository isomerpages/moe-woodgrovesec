_**Look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious.”**_

**Stephen Hawking** <br>
**1946 – 2018**

The Science Department aims to nurture students to become scientific literate citizens. Equipped with a strong grounding in the scientific knowledge and the practices of science, our students will be able to make informed decisions about science related issues, innovate and push the frontiers of science. The enculturation of positive values and attitudes allows them to function well as global citizens with the passion to use science in improving lives of self, society and the environment. We hope to engage our students in real-world phenomena, equip our students to explore the scienctific concepts through experimentation and model making, equip students to make a positive impact to self, and society through our science lessons and activities.

#### Learning Journey to NUS Science Demonstration Lab

Physics students have the opportunity to see the applications of physics through the use many everyday materials in the demonstrations.

  

**_“I used to think that physics are only in the nature of engineering Now I think that physics can be in the matter of every substance and connected through various ways.”_**

  

Objectives: <br>
To allow students to deepen the understanding of the concepts learnt through visually and intellectually Science

#### Secondary 2 Science Trails @ Singapore Science Centre

Our Secondary Two students have the opportunity to see the scientific concepts they learnt in class come to live at the various trails at Science Centre.

  

Objectives: <br>
To allow students to experience the scientific concepts and phenomena that they have learnt or will be learning in their science lessons.
