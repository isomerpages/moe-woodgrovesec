Mission
-------

<p style="text-align:center;">We seek to equip students with<br>Skills<br>Knowledge<br>Attitudes<br>in sports to pursue a healthy lifestyle.</p>

  

**Our department** aims to cultivate in our students a sporting and healthy lifestyle through a structured physical education programme. The Skills, Knowledge, Attitudes (SKA) approach provides students with a systematic structure to learn physical education. The domains ‘S’ and ‘K’ focus on psycho-motor and cognitive development while ‘A’ addresses the affective development of our students. From our PE programme, our students are able to acquire skills and knowledge of 10-12 sports and games as well as values education during their 4-5 years in the school. To further strengthen the rigour of the programme, the department has also put in place an assessment system that helps to level up students’ mastery of sports and games.

  

**With the department mission** in sight, we want our students to be able to demonstrate good sportsmanship and take the responsibility to promote healthy living through sports and CCAs. In addition to the PE programme, the department also leverages on CCA platforms to achieve its mission. The range of CCAs provided by the department is aplenty so as to cater to the different student needs and interests. By having students participating in CCAs, not only will their school experiences be enriched and more meaningful, they will also be provided with opportunities to hone their leadership skills in serving the larger student body.

  

**Highlights of our programmes include:**

*   WGS X-Country Run
*   Inter-class Sports Challenge
*   Sports Enrichment Programme
*   Sec 2 Lifeskills Camp
*   Sec 3 Camp
*   ACES Day
