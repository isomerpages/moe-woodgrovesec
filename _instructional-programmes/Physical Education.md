#### Mission

<p style="text-align:center;">We seek to equip students with<br>Skills<br>Knowledge<br>Attitudes<br>in sports to pursue a healthy lifestyle.</p>

  

**Our department** aims to cultivate in our students a sporting and healthy lifestyle through a structured physical education programme. The Skills, Knowledge, Attitudes (SKA) approach provides students with a systematic structure to learn physical education. The domains ‘S’ and ‘K’ focus on psycho-motor and cognitive development while ‘A’ addresses the affective development of our students. From our PE programme, our students are able to acquire skills and knowledge of 10-12 sports and games as well as values education during their 4-5 years in the school. To further strengthen the rigour of the programme, the department has also put in place an assessment system that helps to level up students’ mastery of sports and games.

  

**With the department mission** in sight, we want our students to be able to demonstrate good sportsmanship and take the responsibility to promote healthy living through sports and CCAs. In addition to the PE programme, the department also leverages on CCA platforms to achieve its mission. The range of CCAs provided by the department is aplenty so as to cater to the different student needs and interests. By having students participating in CCAs, not only will their school experiences be enriched and more meaningful, they will also be provided with opportunities to hone their leadership skills in serving the larger student body.

  

**Highlights of our programmes include:** <br>
*   WGS X-Country Run
*   Inter-class Sports Challenge
*   Sports Enrichment Programme
*   Sec 2 Lifeskills Camp
*   Sec 3 Camp
*   ACES Day

#### Sec 3 Camp

The school organised a 3 day/2 night Adventure Leadership Camp for the Secondary 3 students at Camp Challenge in Home Team NS. This is in line with our mission of shaping character and igniting passion. The students had a chance to practise outdoor education skills learnt during their physical education lessons. They also bonded with their teachers and classmates through team building activities. The highlights of the camp were team building activities and the campfire night!

#### WGS X-Country Run

The objectives are to encourage an active healthy lifestyle that improves the well-being and health of the student and to create a shared experience for him/her while participating together with his/her fellow class and school mates.  

  

During our 7th Annual Cross Country Run at the Woodlands Waterfront, the whole school, consisting of the staff, students and partners (PSG & Alumni), completed the 3km route exhibiting much determination and grit. Everyone was in high spirits and there was much camaraderie shown as racers encouraged each other to cross the finish line in style. It certainly created a shared experience with fond memories for all the participants.
