The English Language and Literature Department adopts a variety of strategies to engage students in both English Language and Literature learning.

  

To create a community of dynamic learners and to provide platforms for independent thinking, routines and tools such as Chalk Talk and Padlet are harnessed in the teaching of writing. For example, Chalk Talk is employed to allow students to generate their own viewpoints, respond to their peers’ viewpoints, and to adopt multiple perspectives when addressing an issue.

As part of the Oral Communication Module for English Language, all Secondary One and Three students showcase individual oral presentations. These presentation opportunities not only help build students’ confidence in public speaking, but they also train students to be critical thinkers and empathetic communicators.

  

The Extensive Reading Programme encourages students to read widely via exposure to different genre and activities. During Reading Periods, students are given extracts of books or short stories and engage in various activities such as ‘Hot Seating’, ‘Freeze Frame, writing of alternative endings, and/or discussions to enhance their understanding of the texts. The Extensive Reading Programme is also connected to aspects of the English curriculum such as oral communication tasks or writing tasks.

Words Go Round
--------------

In conjunction with the Singapore Writers Festival, talks are organised for all Secondary One students. In 2019, a talk titled, “What Makes a Good Story”, was given by Mr Kenneth Kwek, a local author and screenwriter who recently published a children’s book, “Timothy and the Phubbers’.  

  

The main aim of the talk was to introduce students to story writing strategies and methods shared by a Singapore writer. During the one-hour session, Mr Kwek shared some interesting details about his background as a screenwriter, film director and author. He went on to give students a few tips on how to make stories more interesting and engaging to readers.

  

As a continuation from the session, all Secondary One students engaged in writing their own stories collaboratively and individually. At the same time, students were also given the opportunity to participate in a few essay writing competitions which include the Commonwealth Essay Writing Competition 2019 in May and the New York Times Asia-Pacific Writing Competition 2019 in August.
