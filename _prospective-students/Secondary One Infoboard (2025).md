has been sent out via Parent Gateway (PG).</p>
<p>For parents who are not onboard on PG, the e-Registration Package can
be accessed via this&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PqB777KGwjfHj0dNW_nJJRFVA77W_b22/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a></strong>.</p>
