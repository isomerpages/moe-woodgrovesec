Woodgrove Secondary School is offering DSA in the two areas below for admission to Secondary 1.

**Talent Area 1: Community Youth Leadership (Girls and Boys)**

The Community Youth Leadership (CYL) programme envisions every Woodgrover as a future-ready learner and thoughtful leader. The programme aims to develop Woodgrovers to be compassionate leaders with the passion to serve. CYL offers two main platforms to develop and hone students’ leadership traits – the Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programme and the Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme. DSA students will automatically be enrolled into the school’s Student Leadership Development Programme, where they will be provided with a wide variety of opportunities and platforms to carry out student-initiated projects to lead the student body and hone their leadership skills through school events, as well as contribute to the community through our Values-in-Action (VIA) programme.
