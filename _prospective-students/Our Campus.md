Woodgrove Secondary School is a beautiful school fully equipped to meet various learning experiences. Apart from classrooms with lockers for every student, students may learn from special rooms such as the design and technology workshops, science labs and the indoor sports hall. 

In 2023, our student councilors embarked on a project to give you a 360 degree glimpse of the school. Please  [click here](https://app.lapentor.com/sphere/draft-1-1690001139?scene=64bb57c048eb7a3a960a2fc2) to view.
