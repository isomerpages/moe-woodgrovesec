<p>If your child is admitted to a secondary school through DSA-Sec, they
are <strong>not</strong> allowed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submit school choices during the Secondary 1 (S1) posting process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer to another school. They <strong>must</strong> commit to their chosen
school for the duration of the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>
