#### Theme

The theme for 2020 TDD is **‘Together We Keep Singapore Strong’** – which focusses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in everyday lives.

#### 2020 TDD Logo

This year the TDD logo was revamped to a new one with the inclusion of the sixth pillar – Digital Defence (introduced in 2019). A logo design competition was held in late 2019 and 30,000 members of the public voted for the 10 shortlisted designs. The winning design was selected for 2020 TDD commemoration. In summary, the logo symbolizes all Singaporeans playing their part in Total Defence to safeguard Singapore’s future.

On Wednesday, 12 February 2020, Form Teachers conducted TDD CCE lessons using the lesson packages prepared by Hwee Peng and Nora. The lower secondary lesson package focusses on developing students’ understanding on how they could contribute in building a strong and resilient Singapore and appreciating the community First Responders who safeguard the TD six pillars daily. The Secondary 2 students were taught how to play the Guardians of the City II, a Total Defence strategy card game designed to help youths develop a deeper understanding of Singapore’s security threats and the part we play in keeping Singapore safe and secure.
