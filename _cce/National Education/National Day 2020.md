This year’s National Day was celebrated in a different fashion as compared to the previous years. In compliance with the Safety and Management Measures, the parade was downsized to eight representatives from the three Uniformed Groups in Woodgrove Secondary School, three percussionists from the School Band and two National Education Ambassadors as the emcees. No Uniformed Group contingents were involved in the parade. The parade took place on 7 August 2020 and was live-streamed for the whole school to witness.

  

The National Day lesson packages were done in two separate occasions in class. On 3 August 2020, Woodgrovers were brought to look at the challenges that Singapore faced in the past and how Singapore stayed resilient and overcome all odds to become what we are today. On 7 August 2020, the students were given the opportunity to make pledges to express how they want to shape the future of the nation, and to reflect on how they can play their part in achieving their hopes for Singapore.

  

The National Day Celebration 2020 was indeed a different experience for all. Despite the small-scale celebration, this year’s National Day remains an exciting event that all Woodgrovers look forward to.
