Racial Harmony Day (RHD) commemoration went a little differently this year. As with the regulations on safety measures, all school based events had to ensure there were no intermingling of students from different classes. Therefore, the team took the commemoration online, led by the Sec 1 to 3 National Education (NE) Ambassadors.

The theme for this year’s RHD is ‘Multicultural Singapore’, aimed to encourage our youth to cultivate strong relationships with diverse individuals and groups, also to inspire them to take ownership of their roles in building a cohesive Singapore.

  

The Sec 3 NE ambassadors started by designing a RHD trivia to kick start the commemoration. Students could scan a QR code to answer a few questions to test their knowledge on the different cultures and religions in Singapore. The students who managed to answer all questions correctly received a prize.

The lower sec NE ambassadors created a montage video singing along to “Sing our Wishes”, decked in various ethnic costumes. The song was released in 2015 for SG50.

Both the upper and lower secondary lessons included class based discussions on RHD topics like dealing with casual racism and promoting tolerance and interactions within our society. Students also had the opportunity to see how volunteers stepped up in helping those affected by the pandemic, regardless of their race and religion.

  

Students came to school in a myriad of ethnic costumes to parade our society’s rich diversity.

The “Best Dressed Class” (1T1, 2N2, 3N1 & 4T1) from each level were judged based on the participation rate and diversity of ethnic costumes within the class.

Every class also awarded one student who received the “Best Dressed Student”, should they come to school donning an outfit from another culture.

We hope that the students still had a meaningful RHD experience despite the new normal.
