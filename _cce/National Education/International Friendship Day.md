From 13th to 17th April, our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) virtually during the CCE period. With Home-Based Learning kicking in on 8th April 2020 due to the Circuit Breaker measures, the IFD lesson package was uploaded onto Student Learning Space (SLS) platform in place of the classroom lessons. The theme for this year’s commemoration is ‘Beyond Borders’ and the activities focus was on recognising Singapore's interconnectedness to ASEAN countries and the rest of the world and demonstrating care and support for others, regardless of nationality, when we are proactive and take the initiative to emphathise and help one another.

In line with the theme ‘Beyond Borders’, students were informed about Singapore’s interconnectedness with the ASEAN region and world. It emphasises the importance for Singapore to work with other countries to mutually overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, students completed a reflection online on what an individual, community and nation can do to help in global recovery. This provided opportunities for them to demonstrate ownership that they have a part to play in overcoming the COVID-19 challenge as well as to nurture confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.

It is our wish that Woodgrovers and Singaporeans will always cherish our diversity and strive to continuously relate positively to one another.
