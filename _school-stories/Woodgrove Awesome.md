Woodgrove Awesome is the school’s biggest talent show created by students, for students. Mentored by a teacher, students embark on a project that involves auditions, filming, performance and emceeing. Through the many components of this yearly project, students experience teamwork, effective communication and pulling off a show for a 1000+ strong crowd. 

  

Even when COVID-19 struck, our Woodgrovers persevered and refused to be defeated when ‘live’ concerts could not take place. The talent show continued to take center stage in digital form and it was brought into the classrooms. We hope to bring Woodgrove Awesome live again one day. We are proud that Woodgrove Awesome is a tradition of the school that bears testament to the indomitable spirit of Woodgrovers.
