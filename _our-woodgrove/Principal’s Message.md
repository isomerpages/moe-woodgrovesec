**Welcome to the WGS website!**

  

I am honoured and privileged to be the 4th Principal of WGS, carrying forward the good work done by my predecessors. In WGS, we strive to equip our Woodgrovers with the necessary skills and mind-sets to be effective life-long learners. Thus, we believe in creating many learning opportunities and platforms for students to explore, through which they can discover their passions and talents. Beyond the regular secondary school curriculum, we provide real-life applications of learning in all our subjects, particularly through our school’s Applied Learning Programme on Sustainability and Learning for Life Programme on Community and Youth Leadership.

  

While the recent COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges to the educational landscape, there are also exciting opportunities ahead in the dawn of this new digital era which has spurred and championed the use of various digital platforms. As we adapt to new norms and prepare for the implementation of key MOE initiatives in the coming years, such as the use of personal learning devices and Full Subject-Based Banding, I am certain that our whole school community will forge ahead in this new chapter of life with confidence and steadfastness.

  

I welcome you to peruse our website to learn more about the learning experiences available to our students. I am excited for the opportunities for much learning and growth that await us here at WGS in the forthcoming years, and I am confident that our greatest strength lies in our commitment to provide an all-rounded education for our students.
