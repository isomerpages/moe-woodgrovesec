#### STEM for Sustainable Living in the Community

In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and SG Green Plan 2030, the school’s ALP focuses on providing opportunities for our students to apply Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in tackling sustainability-related issues. 

The school organises the ALP through a Tiered Approach:

*   Through Tier 1 ALP, our students will be introduced to sustainability-related issues faced by the world and Singapore through related subjects. As champions of sustainability, students are also encouraged to adopt sustainable living practices and promote these practices to the community they are living in.
    
*   For students with interest and/or aptitude, Tier 2 ALP opportunities allow them to explore further and delve deeper into STEM and sustainability. Some examples of these opportunities include participating in interest-based workshops, online webinars, student-initiated projects, International Exchange programmes with South Korea and Taiwan, as well as serving as Environment Ambassadors.
    
All students are equipped with the twin enablers of Design Thinking and Coding through hands-on learning activities. The Design Thinking Process allows our students to take on a human-centric approach in solving problems, while coding expands the possibilities of the solutions our students can generate.
